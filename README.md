## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Building the HTML part
- Using TailwindCSS
- Computer first (worst error)
- [[TW CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn)] - For use framework
- [[TW DOC](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/flex-basis)] - For styles and more


### What I learned

I think I've improved a little in responsive (which is my biggest problem), I've mostly played with flex and width, I think there's more intelligent to do, plus I started with the desktop version when "mobile first" is much better. I won't make this mistake next time. hoping to improve again on this side, otherwise I've struggled a bit with error management depending on the design, but it does it. you can see and use the code!


### Continued development

- Improve my responsiveness, be more rigorous and better optimize my code.

- Take on bigger projects.
